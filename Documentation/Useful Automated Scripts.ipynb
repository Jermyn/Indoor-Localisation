    "    - this script is a dependent in the _process_barycentric_latest.py_ in algorithm server\n",
    "    - mainly helps to calculate distance from rssi and getting Measured Power\n",
    "    - run it in ec2 server (algorithm server)\n",
    "- sendVitals.py\n",
    "    - script to send vitals to a zmq port firebase can pick up from\n",
    "    - to simulate live reading of vitals\n",
